# DFG project TransTibet - PhD position to be filled...
"TransTibet - Phylogenetic reconstruction of trans-Tibet dispersal events in wingless ground beetles" is a new exciting project where we aim to deepen our understanding of the paleoenvironmental evolution of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) through the study of wingless ground beetles' phylogeny. Over the past decade, we have established ground beetles as a significant paleoenvironmental proxy, particularly for high mountain regions in low latitudes. By combining ecological and phylogenetic data from species endemic to the Himalayan-Tibetan orogeny, we have developed scenarios for the spatio-temporal evolution of paleoenvironments, contributing to our understanding of regional surface uplift in the area. TransTibet addresses the controversial debate surrounding the timing, quantity, and sequence of surface uplift of the TP, a key factor in understanding atmospheric circulation, paleoenvironments, and the evolution of megadiverse biota. Despite evidence suggesting a high elevated proto-Plateau as early as the Paleogene, based on stable isotope paleoaltimetry, and fossil findings, there are still significant uncertainties and disagreements regarding these elevations and the timing of alpine biota's presence on the TP.

Proposed extensions of temperate and alpine environments are shown as colored areas; colored arrows indicate dispersal events in Carabus and frogs.

Our study proposes using wingless ground beetles as a source of paleoecological and paleotopographic information, leveraging the identification of trans-Tibet disjunctions in ground beetle distributions to test and develop new spatio-temporal scenarios for the paleoenvironmental evolution of the TP. By examining the phylogenetic structure of these beetles and dating cladogenetic events, the researchers aim to uncover the topographic and environmental history of the TP.

group, with 14 extant local endemic species. A hypothetical phylogeny of the group is shown to the left, and four different development stages (A–D) of the distributional area are modelled on the current HTO topography; the time slices of these development stages are shown in the tree diagram (intervals marked by black arrows). E.g., if the ancestor of this species group was adapted to the temperate climate, the first bifurcation (beginning of time slice B) corresponds with the point of time in which the distributional area began to separate into a southwestern and an eastern
portion because the uplift of Tibet’s interior topped the temperate climatic belt. At the same time, new habitats continuously develop along orogen margins.">

Our approach, combining field research, taxonomy, molecular genetics, and biogeographic modeling, aims to resolve some of the controversies surrounding the paleoenvironmental history of the TP and contribute significantly to our understanding of its complex geological and biological evolution.
