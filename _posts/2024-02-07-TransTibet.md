# DFG project TransTibet - PhD position to be filled...
TransTibet is a new exiting project on the evolutionary history of ground beetles in high asia and we are looking for an enthusiastic Phd student.

"TransTibet - Phylogenetic reconstruction of trans-Tibet dispersal events in wingless ground beetles" is a project that aims to deepen our understanding of the paleoenvironmental evolution of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) through the study of wingless ground beetles' phylogeny. Over the past decade, we have established ground beetles as a significant paleoenvironmental proxy, particularly for high mountain regions in low latitudes. By combining ecological and phylogenetic data from species endemic to the Himalayan-Tibetan orogeny, they've developed scenarios for the spatio-temporal evolution of paleoenvironments, contributing to our understanding of regional surface uplift in the area.

The project addresses the controversial debate surrounding the timing, quantity, and sequence of surface uplift of the TP, a key factor in understanding atmospheric circulation, paleoenvironments, and the evolution of megadiverse biota. Despite evidence suggesting a high elevated proto-Plateau as early as the Paleogene, based on stable isotope paleoaltimetry, and fossil findings, there are still significant uncertainties and disagreements regarding these elevations and the timing of alpine biota's presence on the TP.

Our study proposes using wingless ground beetles as a source of paleoecological and paleotopographic information, leveraging the identification of trans-Tibet disjunctions in ground beetle distributions to test and develop new spatio-temporal scenarios for the paleoenvironmental evolution of the TP. By examining the phylogenetic structure of these beetles and dating cladogenetic events, the researchers aim to uncover the topographic and environmental history of the TP.

The methodology includes field trips for sample collection, revisions of species groups for accurate taxonomic identification, and the acquisition of fossil data for molecular clock calibration. Phylogenomic and biogeographic analyses will be conducted to understand the evolutionary history and distribution patterns of these beetles, providing insights into the uplift history of the TP and its impact on biota.

This comprehensive approach, combining field research, taxonomy, molecular genetics, and biogeographic modeling, aims to resolve some of the controversies surrounding the paleoenvironmental history of the TP and contribute significantly to our understanding of its complex geological and biological evolution.




# Background
During the last decade, we developed ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) as a new paleoenvironmental proxy in high mountains of low latitudes. We showed that the combination of ecological and phylogenetic information from species groups endemic to the Himalayan-Tibetan orogeny (HTO) allows for the development of scenarios of the spatio-temporal evolution of paleoenvironments and thus, for regional surface uplift in the HTO. To understand the environmental evolution of the central part of the HTO, the Tibetan Plateau (TP), information about timing of trans-Tibet distribution events in wingless ground beetle species groups are particularly informative. The detailed phylogenetic study of these species-groups in combination with a fossil based molecular clock approach and investigation of the habitat preferences of the species will indicate timing of the development of high montane and alpine environments on the TP. The here proposed study will thus provide new data and insight for a better understanding of the paleoecology and paleotopography of the HTO during different stages of orogenesis.
