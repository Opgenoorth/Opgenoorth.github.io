# DFG project TransTibet - PhD position to be filled...
"TransTibet - Phylogenetic reconstruction of trans-Tibet dispersal events in wingless ground beetles" is our exciting new project where Joachim Schmitt and myself aim to deepen our understanding of the paleoenvironmental evolution of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) through the study of wingless ground beetles' phylogeny. Over the past decade, we have established ground beetles as a significant paleoenvironmental proxy, particularly for high mountain regions in low latitudes. By combining ecological and phylogenetic data from species endemic to the Himalayan-Tibetan orogeny, they've developed scenarios for the spatio-temporal evolution of paleoenvironments, contributing to our understanding of regional surface uplift in the area.

The project addresses the controversial debate surrounding the timing, quantity, and sequence of surface uplift of the TP, a key factor in understanding atmospheric circulation, paleoenvironments, and the evolution of megadiverse biota. Despite evidence suggesting a high elevated proto-Plateau as early as the Paleogene, based on stable isotope paleoaltimetry, and fossil findings, there are still significant uncertainties and disagreements regarding these elevations and the timing of alpine biota's presence on the TP.

Our study proposes using wingless ground beetles as a source of paleoecological and paleotopographic information, leveraging the identification of trans-Tibet disjunctions in ground beetle distributions to test and develop new spatio-temporal scenarios for the paleoenvironmental evolution of the TP. By examining the phylogenetic structure of these beetles and dating cladogenetic events, the researchers aim to uncover the topographic and environmental history of the TP.

![Fig. 2. Examples of trans-Tibet distributional patterns in wingless ground beetle species groups: almost continuous distribution in high alpine Deltomerodes (dark blue dots); markedly disjunct distributions in species groups adapted to the cloud forest belt, with NW-C Himalaya-East Tibet disjunction in Microzargus and Pristosia; C Himalaya-East Tibet disjunction in Duvalioblemus and Sinobrosculus; central Himalaya–NW Himalaya disjunction in the Carabus scheibei group. Each dot refers to the distribution of a local endemic species. Distributions are from Facchini & Sciaky (2002);
Deuve (2004, 2014); Schmidt & Hartmann (2009); Gueorguiev (2013); Yan et al. (2021); unpublished data. ](/assets/img/posts/TransTibet Figure 2.jpg)


The methodology includes field trips for sample collection, revisions of species groups for accurate taxonomic identification, and the acquisition of fossil data for molecular clock calibration. Phylogenomic and biogeographic analyses will be conducted to understand the evolutionary history and distribution patterns of these beetles, providing insights into the uplift history of the TP and its impact on biota.

![Simplified model of the development of trans-Tibet disjunct distributional patterns in a hypothetical species group, with 14 extant local endemic species. A hypothetical phylogeny of the group is shown to the left, and four different development stages (A–D) of the distributional area are modelled on the current HTO topography; the time slices of these development stages are shown in the tree diagram (intervals marked by black arrows). E.g., if the ancestor of this species group was adapted to the temperate climate, the first bifurcation (beginning of time slice B) corresponds with the point of time in which the distributional area began to separate into a southwestern and an eastern portion because the uplift of Tibet’s interior topped the temperate climatic belt. At the same time, new habitats continuously develop along orogen margins.](/assets/img/posts/TransTibet Figure 4.jpg)


This comprehensive approach, combining field research, taxonomy, molecular genetics, and biogeographic modeling, aims to resolve some of the controversies surrounding the paleoenvironmental history of the TP and contribute significantly to our understanding of its complex geological and biological evolution.
