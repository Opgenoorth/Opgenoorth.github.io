# DFG project TransTibet - PhD position to be filled...
"TransTibet - Phylogenetic reconstruction of trans-Tibet dispersal events in wingless ground beetles" is a new exciting project where we aim to deepen our understanding of the paleoenvironmental evolution of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) through the study of wingless ground beetles' phylogeny. Over the past decade, we have established ground beetles as a significant paleoenvironmental proxy, particularly for high mountain regions in low latitudes. By combining ecological and phylogenetic data from species endemic to the Himalayan-Tibetan orogeny, we have developed scenarios for the spatio-temporal evolution of paleoenvironments, contributing to our understanding of regional surface uplift in the area. TransTibet addresses the controversial debate surrounding the timing, quantity, and sequence of surface uplift of the TP, a key factor in understanding atmospheric circulation, paleoenvironments, and the evolution of megadiverse biota. Despite evidence suggesting a high elevated proto-Plateau as early as the Paleogene, based on stable isotope paleoaltimetry, and fossil findings, there are still significant uncertainties and disagreements regarding these elevations and the timing of alpine biota's presence on the TP.

Our study proposes using wingless ground beetles as a source of paleoecological and paleotopographic information, leveraging the identification of trans-Tibet disjunctions in ground beetle distributions to test and develop new spatio-temporal scenarios for the paleoenvironmental evolution of the TP. By examining the phylogenetic structure of these beetles and dating cladogenetic events, the researchers aim to uncover the topographic and environmental history of the TP.

Our approach, combining field research, taxonomy, molecular genetics, and biogeographic modeling, aims to resolve some of the controversies surrounding the paleoenvironmental history of the TP and contribute significantly to our understanding of its complex geological and biological evolution.

The overall objective of this project is to provide new insights into the Cenozoic paleoenvironmental evolution of the HTO in context of its uplift history by means of proxy-based data. More specifically, the project aims to date the period when temperate environments appeared in the HTO for the first time, in which part of the HTO this happened, and when the temperate forests disappeared in the central HTO (paleo-Tibet) due to the emergence of subalpine-alpine environments. We will use dated phylogenies of species groups of wingless ground beetles which today are characterized by trans-Tibetan distributional patterns, as paleoenvironmental proxy. The particular objectives result from the answers to the following questions:

1) How old are the crown-groups of the oldest endemic extra-tropical elements in the ground beetle fauna of the HTO? – According to island biogeography theory, it has to be assumed that flight-active ground beetles adapted to the temperate environments, dispersed to the HTO immediately after its uplift to significant heights and evolved winglessness. Therefore, we date the earliest branching in extratropical groups of different beetle lineages endemic to the HTO to estimate the age for the emergence of temperate environments in the mountains system.
2) Are there significant differences in the crown-group ages of extra-tropical beetles endemic to certain parts of the HTO? Are crown-group ages of species groups characterized by trans-Tibet distributions younger than those with geographically restricted distributions? – Winglessness markedly reduces the dispersal ability of beetles in high mountains and results in the evolution of geographical separated lineages in the course of regional uplift. Therefore, we compare dating results in wingless species groups endemic to different parts of the HTO with those with trans-Tibet distributions and derive spatially resolved models for the development of temperate paleoenvironments in the different HTO parts.
3) What are the ages of the respective geographically separated lineages in temperate adapted beetle groups that are characterized by disjunct trans-Tibetan distributional patterns? – We assume that the observed phenomenon of trans-Tibet disjunctions was finalized by the uplift of its central part (TP) into subalpine-alpine heights. Therefore, we date the cladogenetic events in these groups to estimate the age of the uplift-induced break-up of the continuous distributional areas (indirect age estimation of large-scale development of subalpine-alpine environments).
4) What are the ages of strictly alpine groups endemic to the HTO which are characterized by trans-Tibet distributional patterns? – The crown group ages of these species groups will lead us to date the emergence of alpine environments on the TP and therewith, the onset of the final uplift phase in the central HTO (direct age estimation of the emergence of alpine environments).

Based on these objectives, the following working hypotheses are formulated:
1) Crown-groups ages of extra-tropical elements in the HTO ground beetle fauna date back to the Paleogene-Neogene boundary, resulting from uplift-induced Late Oligocene emergence of temperate forests in paleo-Tibet. – Confirmation of this hypothesis would reject uplift models which assume presence of significant elevations in Tibet already during the Eocene.
2) In beetle groups adapted to the temperate climate: Maximum ages of the crown-groups of taxa endemic to certain parts of the HTO are younger than those which are characterized by trans-Tibet distributions. – Confirmation of this hypothesis would support that the earliest significant HTO uplift occurred in paleo-Tibet’s interior, followed by subsequent surface uplift on Plateau margins, and therefore, paleotopographic scenarios which assume significant pre-Miocene elevations in NE- and E-Tibet will be rejected.
3) Crown ages of the respective geographically separated clades of beetles adapted to the temperate climate and characterized by trans-Tibetan disjunctions, date to the end of the Miocene. – Confirmation of this hypothesis would corroborate that the development of an extensive uplift-induced alpine area in central TP did not start before the Late Miocene and therewith, reject HTO uplift models which assume the presence of an Early Neogene alpine Plateau.
4) Maximum ages of crown groups of beetles which are strictly adapted to the alpine belt and characterized by trans-Tibet distributional patterns date to the Late Miocene. – Confirmation of this hypothesis would corroborate the view that the final uplift phase of the HTO with the development of an extent alpine TP did not start before the Late Miocene.

## Reference genome
To facilitate subsequent phylogenomic analyses, we will create a chromosome-level reference genome at the start of the project. For this purpose, we will extract high molecular weight DNA for PacBio HiFi sequencing at the functional genomic centre (Zürich). Scaffolding will be performed with Hi-C sequencing by PhaseGenomics (Seattle) to achieve chromosome level resolution. Because our proposed taxon sampling covers a wide spectrum of the ground beetle diversity from “basal-grade” to so called higher carabids, we will use a species of the Patrobini genus Deltomerodes for reference genome which represents a “middle grade” Carabidae (Schmidt et al. 2021). We expect a genome size of ~200 Mb (Weng et al. 2021). The annotation of the genome will be performed by IGATech. For this purpose, RNA-Seq data will be generated at very high coverage (1000M reads) for a multi-tissue RNA pool followed by an ab initio gene model prediction and a de novo functional annotation (InterProScan GO/motif + Blast of SwissProt entries to attach a semantic description).

# Phylogenomic and biogeographic analyses
Given that a significant portion of the samples are museum specimen (see table 1), the project will be based on two approaches, a targeted sequencing approach reflecting samples with potential issues in DNA quality, as well as whole genome sequencing approach using low coverage sequencing at 5x coverage (lcWGS, Lou et al. 2021) for fresh and well-preserved museum beetle materials. In combination with the reference genome, this will allow us to design additional baits. In the following two paragraphs we will briefly outline the procedure for both approaches.
