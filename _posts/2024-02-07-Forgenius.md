# News
The final field season is about to start. In total, our Marburg/Freiburg team has visited ~ 40 sites across Europe - collecting DNA samples, measuring the exact tree positions of thousands of trees with total stations and flying UAV campaigns. "[Forgenius](https://www.forgenius.eu). This year, we will travel to Scotland, Danmark and a final site in Germay.

# Background
The FORGENIUS project is an H2020 project, funded by the EU — will give an insight into the diversity of European forests and their resilience to climate change. The project uses state-of-the-art technology and knowledge in plant and evolutionary biology, ecology, remote-sensing, genomics, genetics, modelling, and forestry. It aims to upgrade the current European Information System on Forest Genetic Resources (EUFGIS) platform, by adding new types of data and information on the Genetic Conservation Units (GCU), allowing predictions of the fate of European forests in the short, medium, and long term. Such a tool will be the key to invent new, adaptive strategies to preserve these extraordinary natural assets at the continental level.
